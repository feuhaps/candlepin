Steps to install:

1. Install Ruby using the Ruby Installer (http://rubyinstaller.org/) (They really need a path not containing the space)

2. Install the DevKit
	Consider http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16523607/cant-get-ruby-devkit-configuration-file-autogenerated-properly; i.e. add last line to array in dk.rb as here:
	  REG_KEYS = [
		'Software\RubyInstaller\MRI',
		'Software\RubyInstaller\Rubinius',
		'Software\Wow6432Node\RubyInstaller\MRI'
	  ]

	ruby dk.rb init
	ruby dk.rb install
	
3. Then install buildr using gem install buildr

4. Then, in the project directory, do something like:
	ruby .../path/to/ruby/bin/bundle install
	ruby /path/to/ruby/bin/bundle exec /path/to/ruby/bin/buildr
	
5. Then, some ugly errors involving some "msgfmt"-tool occur.

6. Instead: run 
	mvn install
	mvn eclipse:eclipse
